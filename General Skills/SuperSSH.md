For this test, you have to know how to use SSH for connect the website and distinct port.

The command for this is 
```shell
ssh USERNAME@WEBSITE -p PORTNUM
```
We can know that USERNAME should be replaced with "ctf-player" from the sentence "Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 60572 to get the flag?". So type in like this:
```shell
ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 60572
```


Just enter the password, you will get the flag.
```
ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net's password:
```

I replaced the first 7 pictures with the word "picoctf", and it seems to worrk.

Then I use the key word "alphabet", "square", "represent", "flag" and google. I use this hint I found for solving.

However, I could not find the alphabet for replacing the 9th, 12th and the 16th pictures. So I look down for other hints, then I found:

So, the 9th, 12th and the 16th pictures represent 1, 5, 5.

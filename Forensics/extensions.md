After you `cat` the .txt file, you will get useless information.

Because the title of this question called "extensions" and it means file format, such as .jpg and so on. I changed the file extension with the command:
```
mv pico_extention.txt pico_ex.jpg
```
`pico_ex.jpg` is a .jpg file that bases on the info from pico_extention.txt.

Then we open the pic, the ans is right here.
